## Introduction

SwipFit is an AI-powered fashion recommendation and outfit discovery platform that provides personalized clothing suggestions based on user preferences, scientific color theory, and AI-driven insights. The platform includes:

- **Fashion Search Screen** – Traditional e-commerce-style outfit search.
- **Swipe-Based Outfit Discovery** – A Tinder-like interface for fashion recommendations.
- **Personal Outfit Combination Assistant** – AI-driven outfit suggestions based on occasion and user profile.

---

## Features

- AI-powered outfit recommendations using **Google Vertex AI**.
- Advanced **vector similarity search** for personalized suggestions.
- **Next.js-based frontend** for a seamless user experience.
- **Express.js API** for handling backend requests.
- **PostgreSQL & MongoDB** for structured and unstructured data.
- **Upstash Redis caching** for high-performance AI queries.
- **Vercel deployment** with automatic CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- NextAuth.js (Authentication)

### Backend

- Express.js (TypeScript, REST API)
- PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM) – Users, authentication, preferences
- MongoDB (Mongoose) – Outfit embeddings, swipe interactions
- Upstash Redis (Caching)

### AI & Machine Learning

- Google Vertex AI (LLM) via Vercel AI SDK
- Vector similarity search for recommendation engine

### Deployment

- Frontend & API: **Vercel**
- Database: **Neon (PostgreSQL)** & **MongoDB Atlas**
- AI Model: **Google Vertex AI**

---

## Architecture Overview

SwipFit follows a **modular monorepo** structure using TurboRepo for efficient development and deployment. The architecture includes:

- **Microservices-based backend** with dedicated APIs for search, recommendations, and user interactions.
- **AI-driven recommendation engine** with embeddings stored in MongoDB.
- **Event-driven architecture** for handling user actions efficiently.

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18.x)
- PostgreSQL & MongoDB
- Vercel CLI (for deployment)

### Setup Steps

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kanakkholwal/swipfit.git
cd swipfit

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run the development server
pnpm dev
```

## AI Model Integration

SwipFit leverages **Google Vertex AI** for:

- **Image Processing**: Extracting outfit features using vector embeddings.
- **Textual Classification**: Generating outfit descriptions.
- **Reverse Image Search**: Finding visually similar outfits.

Example AI Integration:

```typescript
import { vertexAI } from 'vercel-ai-sdk';

const aiClient = vertexAI({ model: 'text-bison@001' });

const getRecommendations = async (query) => {
  const response = await aiClient.generate({ prompt: `Find similar outfits for ${query}` });
  return response;
};
```

---

## Security Measures

- **AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data.
- **OAuth & JWT authentication**.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- **Environment variable management** for API keys.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- **Rate limiting** using `express-rate-limit`.
- **Redis caching (Upstash)** for AI queries.
- **Lazy loading & pagination** for search/swipe feeds.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with AR/VR** for virtual outfit try-ons.
2. **Blockchain-based digital fashion collectibles (NFTs)**.
3. **Social features** (User-generated posts, comments, etc.).
4. **AI Chatbot for styling advice** using Google Vertex AI.
